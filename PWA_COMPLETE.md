## 🔔 Next Step: Enable Push Notifications (Optional)

To fully activate push notifications:

### 1. Install web-push tool:
```powershell
npm install -g web-push
```

### 2. Generate VAPID keys:
```powershell
web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

### 3. Add to .env:
```env
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BDz...your_public_key...
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=abc...your_private_key...
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@pathpatrol.com
```

### 4. Update service-worker.js:
Replace line 60 with your actual public key

### 5. Test notification permission:
Users will see permission request when they enable notifications

---

## 🌐 Deployment Considerations

### For Production:

1. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require HTTPS (except localhost)
   - Use Streamlit Cloud (has HTTPS)
   - Or deploy behind Nginx with SSL certificate

2. **Static File Serving**: Already configured in `.streamlit/config.toml`

3. **Cache Strategy**: Service worker caches for 30 days (configurable)

4. **Update Strategy**: App prompts users when new version available
